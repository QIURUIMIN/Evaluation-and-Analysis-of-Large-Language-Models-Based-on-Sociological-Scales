# Evaluation-and-Analysis-of-Large-Language-Models-Based-on-Sociological-Scales
This study focuses on the scale evaluation and visualization of the Chinese large language model, aiming to quantify and evaluate whether the language model has/can simulate human personality or psychological traits through a scale.
By building a website platform, we have integrated multiple Chinese large language models on the website, such as Spark iFlytek 1.5, Spark iFlytek 3.0, Spark iFlytek 3.5, etc. Users can choose different language models for specific scale testing. Our scales include personality assessment scales and psychological assessment scales, such as the Big Five personality scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, which can also be uploaded by users themselves. These scales are processed into a format that is readable and answerable by the big language model, and the assessment results will be visualized using data visualization technology to visually display the performance and distribution of the model.
